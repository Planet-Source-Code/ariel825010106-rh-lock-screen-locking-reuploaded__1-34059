Hi... to all VB programmer out there this is [RH] Lock. A locking program, a working program.

- So if you want to test it, I recommend you to create a password for yourself, because maybe you'll get stuck with your computer. 

- Make sure to backup your registry, especially the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE branch before running this program [either by pressing F5 or compile it and run the EXE form].

- Remember your username & password!

- I'm not responsible if you guys have any problem with your computer because using my program.

I'm giving away this program because I want to "share" my hardwork with you guys, and I like to hear your comments, bug reports, or suggestion. 
I never test this on any machine except my own, so please tell me if you encounter any problem with this program. 

If you want to, you can vote for me :). I'll develop this program if the 'people reaction' of this program is very high, because I'm not a full-time programmer. Yes I code VB just for fun.
